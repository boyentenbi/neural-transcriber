# neural-transcriber

Mine and Akuan's neural + WFST transcriber.

Contains code to preprocess TedLium, Librispeech and VCTK from https://github.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet. We'd have used the Switchboard corpus if we had £1500 to spare.

Achieves alignment-free transcription using a neural convolution through time on the MFCC representation of an audio signal.

We tried the following configurations:

1. Character-level acoustic model including a 'space' character. No language model.
2. Character-level acoustic model inlcuding space. WFST language model.
3. Phoneme-level acoustic model and from-scratch beam search language model.
4. Phoneme-level acoustic model and WFST language model.

All but the first were about 2 orders of magnitude slower than https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41176.pdf

From profiling, we know this was due to our language models. However, we ran out of time before we could fully diagnose the problem.
